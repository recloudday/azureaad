<h1>Azure/Entra and Active Directory - Create New Users and Groups</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I successfully managed users and groups within Entra, a powerful identity and access management tool. I started by confirming correct users existed on the account, configuring essential details and access permissions. Next, I created a user group to organize users for streamlined management and policy application. Finally, I assigned ownership of the newly created group to the new user, ensuring they have the necessary permissions to manage group settings and membership. Through this lab, I gained a solid understanding of user and group management within Entra, equipping me with the skills to efficiently manage identities and access in an organization.
